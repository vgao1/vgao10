K08: Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity (python3 -m venv ~/myherozero)
2020-10-06

"python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" creates a virtual Python environment in a directory called myherozero.  
	-A virtual environment is a directory tree that contains Python executable files and a set of its own Python packages 
	that is isolated from a system's directories and the libraries and scripts in other virtual environments.
	-A "system" Python environment contains libraries that were installed as part of the machine's operating system.

-After I ran "python3 -m venv ~/myherozero", a directory called myherozero was created in my home directory.  In the myherozero directory, there were 4
directories (bin, include, lib, lib64) and a file called pyvenv.cfg

-Inside the bin directory, there were 2 files: python and python3.

-In both the lib and lib64 directories, there was a directory called python3.8, which contains a directory called site-packages.
