"""
Our approach: We created a dictionary with an interval's end number as the keys and occupations as the values.
We generated a random number from 0 to 99.8, and based on which interval it lied in, we returned the occupation 
corresponding to that interval.

-----------------------------------------------
Dictionary:                                     |Intervals:
{6.1: 'Management',                             | [0,6.1)
 11.1:'Business and Financial operations',      | [6.1,11.1)
 ...,                                           |  ...
 93.3: 'Production',                            | [87.2,93.3)
 99.8: 'Transportation and material moving'     | [93.3,99.8)
}

If an occupation has 5% chance, its corresponding dictionary key is the previous occupation's interval end number + 5%.

We used a for loop to iterate through the dictionary:
If the random number is less than a key, return the occupation (dictionary value).
If not, check if the random number is less than the next dictionary key.
