What is the MongoDB Database?
-Database: a structured way to store and acess data
-The MongoDB database is a NoSQL document database because MongoDB stores data in documents instead of tables, rows, and columns.  
These documents are stored in collections of documents.

What is a Document in MongoDB?
-A document organizes and stores data as a set of field-value pairs.
{
	<field>:<value>,
	<field>:<value>
}
<field> is a unique identifier.  <value> is data related to an identifier.

-A collection contains many documents that often share fields.
A database contains multiple collections.

What is MongoDB Atlas?
-MongoDB is used in the Atlas cloud database for data storage and retrieval.
-Clusters are groups of servers that store data.  When a cluster is deployed,
the servers are configured as a replica set by default, which is a few connected MongoDB instances
that store the same data.  This setup ensures that if something happens to one of the machines in the replica set,
the data will be available for an application by the working members of the replica set.
-An instance is a single machine in the cloud or locally that runs software.  Atlas is a MongoDB database run in the cloud. 
-Atlas manages cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment (include deploying cloud service
providers that users choose), and allows users to experiment with new tools and features.
-Free-tier: charts, realm, small-scale app
