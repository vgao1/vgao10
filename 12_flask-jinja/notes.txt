K12: ...or The Only Constant is Change? (Jinja2 templating engine)
2020-10-14

Q0: If we remove render_template from the line, the module will not be imported.
This means that it would not be able to be used later on when it is called to open
the file 'model_tmplt.html' in line 16. We predict that the module is used to
open files through python.

Q1: We predict that the URL we need to use to connect to that page is "http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template" 
because app.route("/") led to "http://127.0.0.1:5000".  "my_foist_template" following "/"
is a directory within the directory app.py is in, so we append "/" (separate the 2 directories) followed by
"my_foist_template" to "http://127.0.0.1:5000" .  
  

Q2: In "render_template", the first input, "model_tmplt.html" determines which file
will be opened. The next input, "foo="fooooo"" determines what will be printed in place
of {{ foo }} in the html file. The final input, "collection=coll" determines which list
is called and looped through in {% for item in collection %}. This will The final two variables in
the input are passed to the template engine as arguments.

Observation: We observed that when we typed "http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template" into a
browser, the string 'fooooo' and the list 'coll' took the placeholders in the template.
When run, 'fooooo' was the title of the page and the elements in the list were printed.
