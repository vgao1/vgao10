lj02: m5 -- Chapter 5 MongoDB: Indexing and Aggregation Pipeline
2020-11-24

Aggregation Framework
Another way to query data with aggregate() method
aggregate() method takes in an array where order matters (pipeline)
$match filters for documents that fit a certain condition
$project shows only the specified fields
$group separates data into multiple distinct reservoirs
Syntax: db.collection.aggregate([{“$match”:{ }}, {“$project”:{ }},{“$group”:{ }}])  

sort() and limit()
Both are cursor methods -- applied to the result of the find() method
sort() method can order data based on one or more fields
Use 1 to sort by increasing order and -1 to sort by decreasing order
limit(<num>) returns only the top <num> results
Usually use sort(), then limit() for best results
If you use limit() before sort(), you might miss some of the data that you meant to sort and include in the results set.  Thus, MongoDB assumes that when you use sort() and limit(), you always mean to sort first regardless of the order you type sort() and limit().
cursor.limit().sort() will produce the same results as cursor.sort().limit()

Indexes
Makes query more efficient by storing small portion of data in easy-to-traverse form
Use createIndex() method to make an index by ordering data based on specified field
Single field index orders based only on one field, compound index uses multiple fields

Introduction to Data Modeling
Data Modeling: a way to organize fields in documents to best support application and querying
Data is stored the way that it is used
Information that is accessed together should be stored together

Upsert
We can use a query to locate and update a document.
db.collection.updateOne({<query to locate>}, {<update>}) updates a single document in a collection based on a filter
db.collection.updateOne({<query to locate>}, {<update>},{“upsert”:true}) 
If upsert is true, a document will be updated if there is an existing document that matches the query filter.  If there are no matched documents, a new document will be inserted into the collection.
By default, upsert is set to false.
upsert: true is useful when <update> is enough to create a new document and the new documents will have the same or similar form to other documents in the collection.
