Atlas Data Explorer Features
The Indexes tab of the MongoDB Data Explorer shows how often indexes are used, when the index was created, and who created the index in a collection; these pieces of info can help you evaluate the performance of this database.  Indexes can be created and dropped.  
The Schema Anti-Patterns tab gives advice on your data models after users have issued queries against the collection.
The Aggregation tab allows users to build aggregation pipelines in the User Interface and get a preview of the data returned by each stage of the pipeline.  Stages we can use in an aggregation pipeline include $match, $project, $group, etc.
Order of stages matter!
Can export pipeline to another language -- gives you all the code needed to use the pipeline in your code
