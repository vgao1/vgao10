K11 -- Some Things Never Change (using flask to serve static files)
2020-10-15

*Prediction: 
After activating a virtual environment and running app.py in the terminal, http://localhost:5000/static/foo and http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html will display
text on a webpage.  

http://localhost:5000/static/foo will lead to a webpage with the following lines printed:
"this here some plaintext tho
Q: What happens when you access this file
     via http://localhost:5000/static/foo ?"

http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html will lead to a webpage with the following lines printed:
"this here some plaintext tho" will be printed into the browser.

-The directory that app.py is in is like a home directory of the localhost.  To access a static file via http://localhost:5000/static/<static_file_name>, 
we placed all the static files in a directory called static that is at the same level as app.py in the virtual environment.

-After running app.py in the terminal, each visit or refresh of http://localhost:5000/static/foo led to the download of a file called foo (foo is placed 
in the Downloads folder.  
http://localhost:5000/static/foo doesn't redirect the user to another page.
http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html leads to a webpage displaying "this here some plaintext tho" on a webpage.
