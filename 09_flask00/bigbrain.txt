K09 -- Simple Path to Greatness (Flask app)
2020-10-08

Q0: In Java, an instance of a function is defined with syntax that is similar to Flask(__name__).  
The text that is outside and next to the opening parentheses is usually a function's name and
the text inside is the argument(s).  

Q1: The forward slash ("/") is found in URLs and the path to a file.

Q2: 
Prediction: 
print(__name__) inside the hello_world() will print to the server at the address @app.route("/") points to.
This statement will print "__main__" because that is the module hello_world() is running in.

After running app.py, we noticed that the specific address hello_world() prints to is 127.0.0.1:5000
127.0.0.1 is the IP address and 5000 is the port number.

Q3: 
Prediction: return "No hablo queso" will not cause text to appear anywhere because return doesn't print text.  
There isn't a print statement that prints what the hello_world() function returns.

After running app.py, we noticed that "No hablo queso" was printed on a webpage we were directed to after we entered  
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into a browser's address bar.

The following lines were printed in the terminal after viewing the webpage:
__main__ 
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Oct/2020 19:41:15] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - 

Q4: In Java, code that calls a method of a class is constructed similar to app.run().
app is like a class' name and run is like the method that is called.
