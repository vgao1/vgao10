-When the user clicks on a point inside the canvas, a shape is dropped from that point 
and the shape bounces when it hits a border of the canvas.
-The default shape that is drawn is a square. 
-If the user clicks the "Toggle Shape" button and the previous shape mode was a square, 
the shape mode becomes a right triangle. 
-If the "Toggle Shape" button is clicked and the previous shape mode was a triangle, 
the shape mode becomes a circle.
-If the "Toggle Shape" button is clicked and the previous shape mode was a circle, 
the shape mode becomes a square.
-If a user clicks in the canvas for a shape mode when that shape is already drawn, 
that shape in the canvas will be erased and redrawn at the point the user just clicked on; 
the color of the shape might change due to the generation of a new random integer 
for the shape's color.
-The "Clear" button erases all the shapes in the canvas.
