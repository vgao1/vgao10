-csv.DictReader() reads in the csv file and stores its values in a dictionary 

-Parameters: variables you want to insert into the tuple.  Parameters are placed it in the second argument of the insert command 
For example, the parameters of a table called courses are Code, Mark, ID.
params = (Code, Mark, ID)
The insert command for this table is 'INSERT INTO courses(Code,Mark,ID) VALUES(?,?,?)', params)

-The question marks inside the parentheses of VALUES() are placeholders for values that will be inserted later, in this case they are binded in the params variable.

-"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" prevents the creation of tables with the same name as the tables in an existing .db file that data is stored in.
If you run the Python script more than once without deleting the .db file called DB_FILE in the sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) command, a new .db file won't 
be created every time you run the Python script.

-To view the contents of a .db file, 
1. In the terminal: $sqlite3 <db_filename>
2. .tables allows you to view the names of the tables.
For this assignment, ".tables" outputs "courses	  students"
3. SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
Ex: SELECT * FROM courses shows all of the columns names and rows of data in the courses table
4. SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> shows the data in a column of the table.
Ex: SELECT Code FROM courses shows data in the Code column of the courses table.
The Code column contains the names of the class each student is taking.
